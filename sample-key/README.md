Sample TOTP Keys
================

These keys correspond to the hard-coded key found in `connectiqtotpgeneratorView.mc`.

- The QR Code (`sample_key_qr_code.png`) can be scanned with an app like Google Authenticator, or any other app that supports the Key Uri Format:
  https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format
- `sample_key.txt` contains the URI used to generate the QR code, as well as the hexadecimal representation of the bytes that comprise the key.

You can import this key into an app like Google Authenticator, and then verify that the TOTP codes generated by the app match those of the sample Garmin IQ app provided here.
